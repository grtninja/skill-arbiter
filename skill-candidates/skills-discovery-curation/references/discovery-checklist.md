# Skill Discovery Checklist

1. List local installed skills and any blacklisted entries.
2. Route the work through `skill-hub` and capture the recommended chain.
3. For multi-repo operators, run `skills-cross-repo-radar` and capture the latest JSON report.
4. Include `skill-common-sense-engineering` when avoidable mistakes or hygiene regressions recur.
5. Include `skill-auditor` when new/updated skills are in scope.
6. Include `skill-enforcer` when policy alignment is required across repos.
7. Identify repeated tasks in target repo (release, CI triage, policy checks, packaging, etc.).
8. Match tasks to existing skills before proposing new ones.
9. For each candidate, record `skill-auditor` classification (`unique` vs `upgrade`) and nearest peer.
10. Admit candidates one-by-one with `skill-arbiter` personal-lockdown mode.
11. Require arbiter status `pass` before marking candidates admitted.
12. Keep only proven skills pinned immutable.
