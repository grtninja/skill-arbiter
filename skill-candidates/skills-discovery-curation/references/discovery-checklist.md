# Skill Discovery Checklist

1. List local installed skills and any blacklisted entries.
2. Identify repeated tasks in target repo (release, CI triage, policy checks, packaging, etc.).
3. Match tasks to existing skills before proposing new ones.
4. Admit candidates one-by-one with `skill-arbiter` personal-lockdown mode.
5. Keep only proven skills pinned immutable.
