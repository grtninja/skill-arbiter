# No-Churn Rules

Use these rules to keep Playwright automation skill behavior quiet on churn-sensitive hosts.

1. Keep the skill package text-only (`SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, scripts, references).
2. Never add icon/image assets to the skill package.
3. Keep run outputs in task folders, not under the skill directory.
4. Use explicit CLI commands and avoid background watchers.
5. Rerun preflight after skill edits.
