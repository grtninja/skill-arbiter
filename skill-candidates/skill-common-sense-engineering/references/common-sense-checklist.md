# Common-Sense Checklist

Use this checklist before finalizing work.

## Before Editing

1. State the objective in one sentence.
2. Confirm the target files and avoid unrelated churn.
3. Prefer existing scripts/workflows over one-off ad hoc steps.

## During Work

1. Keep changes minimal and reversible.
2. Verify assumptions with commands, not memory.
3. When recurring friction appears, update the related skill/checklist immediately.

## Before Completion

1. Check working tree for accidental artifacts:
   - `__pycache__/`
   - `*.pyc`
   - temporary logs and scratch files
2. Run required repo validation commands.
3. Summarize evidence and unresolved risks clearly.
